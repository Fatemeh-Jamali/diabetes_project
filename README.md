# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction App

A simple and interactive web application for predicting the likelihood of diabetes using machine learning (XGBoost). Built with Streamlit.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is based on the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**. It uses various health-related features such as BMI, blood pressure, glucose level, etc. to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes.

The model is trained using  Random Forest and deployed as a web app using Streamlit, allowing users to input data and receive real-time predictions.
